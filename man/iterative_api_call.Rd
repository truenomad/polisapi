}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The URL for the API endpoint to which the GET request is made.}

\item{token}{The authorization token required for the API request.}

\item{max_attempts}{The maximum number of attempts to make the API call.
Default is 3 attempts.}

\item{show_progress}{Logical. If TRUE, displays a progress bar across
iterative requests; if FALSE, suppresses progress.}

\description{
This function attempts to make an API call to a specified URL using the GET
method. It includes a retry mechanism, where the request is attempted up to a
specified number of times (\code{max_attempts}) before giving up. If the request
is successful and returns a 200 status code, the response is returned. If any
errors occur or if a non-200 status code is received, the function will wait
for 5 seconds and retry the request. After the maximum number of attempts, if
the request still fails, the function stops with an error message.
